# Low-Power-Comparator-using-CMOS-technology
--This comparator design was simulated using Synopsys custom compiler as apart of hackathon organised jointly by Synopsys India ,VLSI System Design and IIT Hyderabad

-- The paper or the report submitted for this hackathon can be found ["My Paper"](https://github.com/Debjyoti-Banerjee/Low-Power-Comparator-using-CMOS-technology/blob/main/Debjyoti_comparator_hackathon.pdf)  and the .cir file for simulation can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Debjyoti-Banerjee/Low-Power-Comparator-using-CMOS-technology/blob/main/netlist.cir.pdf) as well.


--This paper reports or portrays the low power and
high speed comparator design using CMOS technology of 28nm
and evaluated using synopsis tools.Design based on two stage
CMOS opamp technique with 1.05 volt Vdd as the corresponding supply voltage.Finally comparing the proposed results with
earlier work done

## INTRODUCTION

Comparator is an important device widely used in Analog
to Digital Converters used in large number of application
using low power and audio solutions.Power consumption and
speed are key factors considered while designing comparators.Comparators are classified into open loop and regenrative
comparators using positive feedback.

The comparator idea needs to be researched and popularised more and more and this is because in digital circuits its either "YES" or "NO" and comparing the given voltage to  a known reference is the most sort of feasible thing that helps in digital circuit and has huge applications in the present circuit systems 

First test or draft rough test of the circuit was done using [esim](https://esim.fossee.in/home) and also using Cadence Virtuoso before implementing it in Synopsys design compiler.
