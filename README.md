# Low-Power-Comparator-using-CMOS-technology
--This comparator design was simulated using Synopsys custom compiler as apart of hackathon organised jointly by Synopsys India ,VLSI System Design and IIT Hyderabad

-- The paper or the report submitted for this hackathon can be found ["My Paper"](
--This paper reports or portrays the low power and
high speed comparator design using CMOS technology of 28nm
and evaluated using synopsis tools.Design based on two stage
CMOS opamp technique with 1.05 volt Vdd as the corresponding supply voltage.Finally comparing the proposed results with
earlier work done
